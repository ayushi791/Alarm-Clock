### Alarm-Clock
Created an alarm clock using only Vanilla JavaScript, without any libraries or frameworks for JavaScript.


##### Features:
###### 1. Clock face
- Clock showing the current time, updating it every second (seconds,mins,hrs)

###### 2. Set Alarm
- Provides input boxes to set an alarm (hr,min,sec, am/pm)
- Once a user sets the time and clicks “Set Alarm” button, an alarm is added to the "Upcoming Alarms" list below.
- When the alarm goes off, a JS alert pops in the browser, showing a message and playing a small alarm sound.

###### 3. Alarms list
- Displays a list of all the alarms set by the user.
- For each alarm, gives user a "Delete" button to delete the alarm.
- When the user deletes an alarm, it does not alerts the user.
