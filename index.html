<!-- Create an alarm clock. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).

Features:
1. Clock face
- Clock showing the current time (seconds,mins,hrs should change as time changes)

2. Set Alarm
- Provide input boxes to set an alarm (hr,min,sec, am/pm)
- Once the sets the time and click “Set Alarm” button, add that alarm to the alarms list below
- When the alarm goes of just use JS alert function to alert in the browser

3. Alarms list
- Display a list of all the alarms set by user
- Delete alarm
- For each alarm give a delete button to delete the alarm
- When the user deletes an alarm make sure it “does not alerts the user” -->


<!-- In this example, we have an HTML layout with a clock display, input fields to set the alarm time, and an unordered list (<ul>) to display the alarms. The CSS file is used to style the elements.

    The JavaScript code handles the logic of updating the clock display every second, setting alarms, adding alarms to the UI, removing alarms, and checking alarms against the current time. The setInterval function is used to call the updateClock function every second.
    
    When an alarm matches the current time, an alert is displayed, and the corresponding alarm is removed from the UI and the alarms array.
    
    Please note that this example does not persist alarms after a page refresh since it doesn't involve backend or database integration. If you need to persist alarms, you would need to implement additional functionality using technologies like local storage or a backend server.
    
    Remember to have all the files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) in the same directory and run the index.html file in a web browser to see the alarm clock with the specified features. -->
